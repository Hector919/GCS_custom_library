### Frequently Asked Questions

##### Where do I get myself a neat Sci-fi material Sword or Vibroblade?

Get the weapon you'd like to have a fancy version of, and put the Superfine, Vibroblade or both modifiers from the "Gear Modifiers" library on it. As GCS isn't finicky enough to do so automatically, you'll need to manually apply part of the statline changes yourself, in particular:
- Changing the Armor divisor to (2) for Superfine weapons
- Changing the Armor divisor to (3) and adding 1d of damage for Vibroblades
- Changing the Armor divisor to (5) and adding 1d of damage for Superfine Vibroblades
Note: Vibroblades consume electric power while running, so I recommend duplicating the already existing melee attack entry, keeping one unmodified as the one with the vibro-mode turned off, and modifying the second one into the one with it turned on

##### How do I put a scope, suppressor or other Accessory on my Gun?

Scopes, Silencers and other things that change the stats of a firearm are built as Equipment Modifiers, and as such can be found in the "Gear Modifiers" library.  
Attachment Weapons (underbarrel shotguns, grenade launchers, electrolasers etc.) are made as pieces of equipment in themselves. They're meant to be bought separately, and can be modified separately as you'd like.
